## Abstract:

A major concern of non-proliferation is the diversion of significant quantities from the nuclear fuel cycle.
These diversions must be detected in a timely manner using signatures and observables in order to properly safegaurd
the fuel cycle. Pyroprocessing is an up and coming reprocessing technology capable of both converting current generation
waste into molten salt fuel, and reprocessing next generation molten salt fuel types. With a new reprocessing technology comes
different signatures and observables, necessitating new methods of determining proliferation. The goal of this research is to
identify potential signs of pyroprocessing diversion, as well as adapt fuel cycle algorithms to a modular fuel cycle program,
Cyclus, and verify its potential to detect nefarious actors with novel observables.
